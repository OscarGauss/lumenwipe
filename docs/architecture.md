## 1. What this is

LumenWipe is a guided, non-custodial tool that walks a user through closing a Stellar account from start to finish. It removes everything that holds an account open, converts leftover assets to XLM, and merges the account into a destination address, returning the locked reserves to the user.

"Closing" a Stellar account is not a single operation. An account can only be merged once it holds no subentries and sponsors no other account. Getting there means unwinding whatever the account accumulated over its life: trustlines, open DEX offers, data entries, extra signers, liquidity pool shares, and positions in DeFi protocols such as Blend, Aquarius, Soroswap, Phoenix, and FxDAO. Each of those steps is its own transaction, with its own ordering constraints and its own failure modes.

The project extends the public-domain [stellar.expert/demolisher](https://stellar.expert/demolisher/public) tool built by Orbit Lens. That tool handles the classic case well: it cancels offers, sells assets on the SDEX, removes trustlines and data entries, works with multisig accounts, and can merge into exchange addresses through an intermediary account. It does not support Soroban, so any account with a Blend loan, an Aquarius LP position, or a Soroswap pair share cannot be closed with it today. This project keeps the parts that work, rebuilds them on the current Stellar stack, and adds full Soroban and DeFi parity, a read-only backend, an allowance inspector, and a production-grade UX designed for irreversible actions.

The tool signs every transaction in the browser. Secret keys never reach a server. The backend is read-only and stateless: it aggregates data, it never holds funds or keys.

Core stack at a glance:

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js, TypeScript, open source and self-hostable |
| Stellar SDK | `@stellar/stellar-sdk` (classic and Soroban) |
| Wallets | stellar-wallets-kit (SEP-43), plus an in-memory secret-key mode |
| Network access | Stellar RPC: live reads, simulation, submission, events |
| Enumeration | stellar.expert API (existing indexer), pluggable |
| Routing | Soroswap Aggregator API, with SDEX paths as fallback |
| DeFi detection | OctoPos primary, Orion fallback |
| Backend | Read-only Next.js API routes, stateless, Redis cache |

## 2. The problem

Stellar has more than ten million accounts on mainnet, and a large share of them are stale, abandoned, or effectively locked. Two structural facts create the problem.

First, every account locks XLM in reserve. The base reserve is 0.5 XLM. An account must hold a minimum balance of two base reserves (1 XLM) plus one base reserve (0.5 XLM) for each subentry it owns: each trustline, offer, data entry, and extra signer. A pool-share trustline counts as two base reserves. So an account with four trustlines, two offers, one data entry, and one extra signer locks `(2 + 8) * 0.5 = 5 XLM` that the user cannot spend until the entries are removed. Across millions of accounts, this is a meaningful amount of capital frozen in the ledger.

Second, closing an account cleanly is a manual, multi-step process that most users cannot perform. Any leftover entry causes the final `ACCOUNT_MERGE` to fail with `ACCOUNT_MERGE_HAS_SUB_ENTRIES`. A user has to know to cancel every offer, exit every DeFi position, sell every asset, remove every trustline, clear every data entry, and drop every extra signer, in a valid order, before the merge will succeed. Miss one and the merge reverts.

Centralized exchanges make it worse. No major exchange supports `ACCOUNT_MERGE`. A user who wants to send their remaining XLM to an exchange cannot merge directly into a deposit address, so the final 1 XLM base reserve stays frozen on the ledger. The reference demolisher solves this with an intermediary account, and this project keeps that approach.

Three groups of users feel this most: individuals consolidating or abandoning wallets, exchanges that need to help users recover funds, and DeFi users with open positions across Stellar protocols. The last group has no tool today, because the existing demolisher has no Soroban support.

## 3. How a Stellar account closes

`ACCOUNT_MERGE` transfers the entire XLM balance of the source account to a destination and deletes the source account from the ledger. The protocol enforces strict preconditions. The pre-flight analysis in this tool exists to detect and clear every one of them before it builds a merge transaction.

The merge fails with one of these result codes if a precondition is unmet:

| Result code | Cause | How the tool resolves it |
|---|---|---|
| `ACCOUNT_MERGE_HAS_SUB_ENTRIES` | Source still has trustlines, offers, data entries, or extra signers | Remove every subentry in earlier steps before the merge |
| `ACCOUNT_MERGE_IS_SPONSOR` | Source sponsors reserves for another account | Detect in pre-flight, block the merge, explain that sponsorships must be revoked first |
| `ACCOUNT_MERGE_IMMUTABLE_SET` | Source has the `AUTH_IMMUTABLE` flag set | Detect in pre-flight, block with a clear explanation (the account cannot be merged) |
| `ACCOUNT_MERGE_SEQNUM_TOO_FAR` | Source sequence number is above the current ledger bound | Surface the condition; rarely hit in practice |
| `ACCOUNT_MERGE_NO_ACCOUNT` | Destination does not exist | Verify the destination on the ledger before submitting |
| `ACCOUNT_MERGE_DEST_FULL` | Destination would exceed the maximum XLM an account can hold | Surface as a blocker |
| `ACCOUNT_MERGE_MALFORMED` | Source equals destination, or otherwise malformed | Validation rejects this at input time |

The pre-flight checks map directly onto these codes. Sponsorship detection prevents `ACCOUNT_MERGE_IS_SPONSOR`. Subentry enumeration and removal prevent `ACCOUNT_MERGE_HAS_SUB_ENTRIES`. Destination verification prevents `ACCOUNT_MERGE_NO_ACCOUNT`. The tool never submits a merge it expects to fail.

Note that being a *claimant* of a claimable balance does not block the merge, but *sponsoring* one does, because the sponsor pays its reserve. An account that created claimable balances is their sponsor, so those must be resolved first.

## 4. System architecture

The system has three layers: a browser client that builds and signs every transaction, a thin read-only backend that aggregates data, and the Stellar network plus the external data services the backend reads from. The trust boundary is the browser. Private keys and signing live entirely on the client side. Nothing the backend does can move a user's funds.

### At a high level

In plain English: LumenWipe is a web app that runs in the user's browser. The user connects a wallet (or, in advanced mode, pastes a key); the app reads the account, works out everything that has to be undone to close it, and walks the user through signing each transaction. Keys never leave the browser. A small read-only service only gathers public data (balances and DeFi positions) so the app can build an accurate plan. The app reaches the network through Stellar RPC, reads what the account holds from an existing indexer (stellar.expert), detects DeFi positions through a position API (OctoPos or Orion), and finds the best route to sell leftover assets through Soroswap. The stack is Next.js and TypeScript for the app, the official Stellar SDK, stellar-wallets-kit for wallet connections, and a thin read-only TypeScript backend that only reads and caches public data.

Two things to read off this diagram. The signed-XDR arrow runs from the client directly to Stellar RPC. The backend is never in the signing or submission path. And every external read source is pluggable: RPC, the indexer, the routing API, and the DeFi position API can each be swapped or pointed at a self-hosted instance without touching the transaction logic.

## 5. Data sources, and why we run no indexer

Building LumenWipe requires reading account state, and that state lives in two places the same way the network splits its tooling: classic ledger state, and live or Soroban state.

A practical constraint shapes the whole data design. Stellar RPC's `getLedgerEntries` can only return entries whose keys you already know. You pass it serialized `LedgerKey` values (up to 200 per request) and it returns those exact entries. It has no scan, filter, or "list all trustlines for this account" capability. To build a trustline `LedgerKey` you already need the asset; to read an offer you already need the offer ID. RPC alone therefore cannot tell you what an unknown account holds.

Enumerating an account's subentries (every trustline, offer, data entry, claimable balance, pool share, signer, and sponsorship relationship) requires an indexer. The project takes a clear position here: we do not build or operate an indexer, and we do not depend on SDF-hosted Horizon. SDF reduced its hosted Horizon to one year of history in August 2024 and steers integrators toward Stellar RPC plus ecosystem data services. Running a bespoke indexer (Captive Core, Galexie, a database) is not the problem this project exists to solve, and it would be operational weight with no payoff for the tool.

Instead the tool reads from existing, production-grade sources through pluggable adapters:

| Concern | Source | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Enumerate subentries (trustlines, offers, data entries, claimable balances, pool shares, signers, sponsorships) | stellar.expert API (existing indexer; primary) | RPC cannot enumerate. stellar.expert already indexes this and is the data layer behind the reference demolisher. |
| Alternate enumeration for self-hosting | Any Horizon-compatible provider (Blockdaemon, QuickNode, Validation Cloud, and similar), via the same adapter interface | Lets an operator who self-hosts avoid any single read dependency. Optional, not required. |
| Live ledger-entry reads for known keys, right before building each transaction | Stellar RPC `getLedgerEntries` | Authoritative current state. Builds exact transaction parameters and avoids acting on stale data. |
| Soroban simulation (footprint, authorization, resource fees) | Stellar RPC `simulateTransaction` | Required for every `InvokeHostFunction` operation. |
| Transaction submission and confirmation | Stellar RPC `sendTransaction`, `getTransaction` | Client submits and polls directly. |
| Contract events (for example, discovering `approve` spenders for the allowance inspector) | Stellar RPC `getEvents`, with the indexer for older windows | RPC retains a bounded event window. |
| DeFi position detection across protocols | OctoPos (primary) / Orion (fallback) DeFi Position API | Builds on a funded DeFi Position API instead of reinventing protocol indexing. |
| Swap routing and swap-XDR construction | Soroswap Aggregator API (primary), stellar.expert paths (classic SDEX fallback) | Best-available routes across Soroban and classic venues without a Horizon dependency. |
| Exchange and anchor registry (mediator and memo rules) | Static JSON sourced from the stellar.expert directory | Determines which destinations need the mediator flow and a memo. |

The split is deliberate. An indexer answers "what does this account hold". RPC answers "what is the exact current state of this specific entry, right now, and will this transaction succeed". The tool enumerates with the indexer, then re-reads each entry over RPC immediately before building the transaction that touches it, so it never signs a transaction based on stale enumeration data.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    acct["Source account"] --> enum["Enumerate subentries<br/>(stellar.expert indexer)"]
    acct --> defiq["Detect DeFi positions<br/>(OctoPos / Orion)"]
    enum --> verify["Re-read each entry live<br/>(Stellar RPC getLedgerEntries)"]
    defiq --> verify
    verify --> plan["Build execution plan"]
    plan --> sim["Simulate Soroban steps<br/>(Stellar RPC simulateTransaction)"]
    sim --> submit["Submit signed XDR<br/>(Stellar RPC sendTransaction)"]
```

### Data freshness and consistency

DeFi position data is a snapshot, and acting on a stale snapshot would build a wrong exit. The position API returns freshness metadata with every response: a staleness value in seconds, the last indexed ledger, and a partial-result flag when some protocols could not be read. The tool uses this directly. If position data is older than a short threshold it refreshes before building the plan, and it shows the ledger and staleness so the user knows how fresh the view is.

Consistency across the boundary between enumeration and execution is the harder problem. Enumeration says a trustline or position exists; the exact amount can move before the user signs. The tool's guarantee is the live re-read: every transaction is built from a fresh `getLedgerEntries` read of the specific entries it touches, taken immediately before construction, not from the enumeration snapshot, and Soroban exits are simulated against current state before signing. Enumeration decides what to do; a live read decides the exact parameters. That keeps the tool from acting on data that moved.

## 6. Frontend architecture

The frontend is a Next.js application in TypeScript. It owns all transaction construction, signing, and submission. It holds the entire flow as an explicit state machine so a user can leave and resume without losing progress, which matters because a full wind-down is several sequential transactions, not one.

### 6.1 State machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Analyzing: submit source + destination
    Analyzing --> PreflightComplete: analysis succeeds, plan built
    Analyzing --> Aborted: account not found or blocked
    PreflightComplete --> SignerSetup: multisig detected
    PreflightComplete --> StepExecuting: single-signer
    SignerSetup --> StepExecuting: enough signatures gathered
    StepExecuting --> StepConfirmed: ledger confirms step
    StepExecuting --> StepFailed: submission or simulation error
    StepFailed --> StepExecuting: retry same step
    StepConfirmed --> StepExecuting: next step
    StepConfirmed --> Complete: merge confirmed
    Complete --> [*]
    StepExecuting --> Aborted: user cancels
    StepFailed --> Aborted: user cancels
```

Each transition is written to a local session store in IndexedDB. The store holds the source and destination addresses, the network, the ordered plan, which steps have confirmed and their transaction hashes, and the ephemeral mediator public key when one is in use. It never holds secret keys or fully-signed envelopes beyond the step currently in flight. On re-entry the tool re-runs the analysis and reconciles against on-chain state, so a step that already confirmed (or was completed externally) is skipped rather than repeated.

### 6.2 Transaction builder

The builder is a pure module: account state in, an ordered list of unsigned transaction envelopes out. It has no network side effects, which makes it directly unit-testable. Each envelope carries its step index, a human-readable description, an estimated fee, and its dependencies (the steps that must confirm first). For classic steps it builds operations directly with the Stellar SDK. For Soroban steps it assembles `InvokeHostFunction` operations and defers footprint, authorization, and resource fee to RPC simulation. The builder enforces the 100-operations-per-transaction protocol limit and splits oversized steps into batches.

### 6.3 Wallet integration and signing

Signing has two paths. The primary path is [stellar-wallets-kit](https://github.com/Creit-Tech/Stellar-Wallets-Kit), which gives a unified interface across Freighter, xBull, Albedo, LOBSTR, Rabet, Hana, WalletConnect, and others. The application passes an unsigned XDR and receives a signed XDR through `signTransaction`; the underlying private key never enters the application. For Soroban operations the kit also signs authorization entries through `signAuthEntry`. The secondary path is an advanced secret-key mode for users whose keys are not in any wallet. In that mode the key lives only in memory, never in any persisted storage, and is cleared after each signing operation. Section 13 details the handling.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    env["Unsigned transaction envelope"] --> review["XDR review (collapsible)"]
    review --> choice{"Signing method"}
    choice -->|"wallet"| kit["stellar-wallets-kit<br/>signTransaction / signAuthEntry"]
    choice -->|"advanced"| key["Secret key in memory"]
    kit --> signed["Signed XDR"]
    key --> signed
    signed --> confirm["Explicit irreversibility confirmation"]
    confirm --> send["sendTransaction (Stellar RPC)"]
    send --> poll["Poll getTransaction until confirmed"]
    poll --> next["Mark step confirmed, advance"]
```

For multisig accounts the kit and secret-key paths both support accumulating signatures: the tool collects signatures from several keypairs or wallets in sequence on the same envelope until the account thresholds are met, then submits. Each individual key is cleared from memory immediately after its signature is applied.

## 7. Read-only backend service

The backend is a stateless, read-only API layer whose only job is to aggregate read data the client cannot efficiently fetch itself, and to cache it. It runs as the API routes of the same Next.js service rather than a separate microservice, which keeps deployment to one open-source application. It accepts no secret keys, builds no signed transactions, and holds no funds. If it were fully compromised it could return wrong read data, which the client surfaces through confirmations and on-chain simulation, but it could never sign or move anything.

It exposes a small read-only REST surface:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/account/:address/analysis` | Full pre-flight analysis: balances, subentries, sponsorships, multisig, reserves, detected DeFi positions, claimable balances, and computed merge blockers |
| `GET /v1/account/:address/positions` | Normalized DeFi positions, proxied and cached from OctoPos or Orion |
| `GET /v1/routing/convert` | Best conversion route for an asset pair and amount, with estimated and minimum receive amounts |
| `GET /v1/mediator/check/:destination` | Whether a destination needs the mediator flow and a memo, using the exchange registry and a ledger existence check |
| `POST /v1/mediator/prepare` | An unsigned XDR that creates and funds the temporary mediator account from the user's account |
| `GET /v1/health` | Component status for indexer, RPC, and the DeFi position providers |

### 7.1 DeFi position adapter

The backend normalizes either OctoPos or Orion behind one adapter interface, so the rest of the system never sees provider-specific shapes. OctoPos (Untangled Finance) and Orion (Daccred) are the two funded DeFi Position APIs in the Stellar ecosystem, and the backend builds on them. The adapter runs OctoPos as primary and falls back to Orion on error or stale data. If both are unavailable the tool enters a degraded mode: classic entries process normally, and the user is warned that DeFi positions could not be detected and must be checked manually.

Both providers return a similar shape: a position payload, an enrichment dictionary (asset symbols, decimals, USD prices and their source, contract names and versions), and a meta block with freshness and confidence fields. The adapter maps these onto one normalized model so the transaction builder sees a single contract:

| Normalized field | Source | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Positions per protocol (supply, borrow, LP, backstop, CDP) | Provider position payload | Drives which exit steps the plan includes |
| `data_staleness_seconds`, `last_indexed_ledger` | Provider meta block | Freshness gate before building the plan (Section 5) |
| `partial_result` | Provider meta block | Marks protocols the provider could not read; those positions are flagged, not guessed |
| `attribution_confidence` | Provider meta block | Low confidence triggers a notice to verify positions on an explorer before proceeding |
| Asset and contract enrichment | Provider enrichment dictionary | Human-readable labels in the plan view, without extra lookups |

The adapter uses the authenticated tier where an API key is configured and the public tier otherwise. It sends only the address it was asked to analyze, and it caches only public position data.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    req["Position request for address"] --> octo["Query OctoPos (5s timeout)"]
    octo -->|"fresh"| ok1["Return OctoPos data"]
    octo -->|"stale or error"| orion["Query Orion (5s timeout)"]
    orion -->|"fresh"| ok2["Return Orion data"]
    orion -->|"stale or error"| degraded["Degraded mode:<br/>classic steps only,<br/>warn user to verify DeFi manually"]
```

### 7.2 Caching

Read data is cached with short TTLs, keyed by address: positions for tens of seconds, routing for a few seconds (routing is time sensitive), analysis for a few seconds with explicit refresh on user request. The cache holds public, read-only data. It holds no keys and no user identity.

## 8. The execution plan

From the analysis the tool generates a deterministic, ordered plan. Same account state, same plan. The order satisfies ledger constraints: you cannot withdraw collateral while a loan is open, you cannot remove a trustline while it holds a balance, and you cannot merge while any subentry remains.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    s1["1. Normalize signers<br/>(SetOptions: remove extra signers, thresholds to 0/1/1)"]
    s2["2. Remove data entries<br/>(ManageData, batched by 100)"]
    s3["3. Claim selected claimable balances<br/>(ClaimClaimableBalance, optional)"]
    s4["4. Cancel DEX offers<br/>(ManageSellOffer / ManageBuyOffer, amount 0)"]
    s5["5. Withdraw AMM and LP positions<br/>(classic LiquidityPoolWithdraw + Soroban pool withdrawals)"]
    s6["6. Exit DeFi protocols<br/>(Blend, Phoenix, FxDAO: repay then withdraw)"]
    s7["7. Convert assets to XLM<br/>(PathPaymentStrictSend / Soroban swaps)"]
    s8["8. Remove trustlines<br/>(ChangeTrust limit 0, batched by 100)"]
    s9["9. Merge account<br/>(AccountMerge, direct or via mediator)"]
    s1 --> s2 --> s3 --> s4 --> s5 --> s6 --> s7 --> s8 --> s9
```

A few details that matter for correctness:

- Signer normalization runs first when extra signers exist, so a single key can authorize every later step. It removes each extra signer with `SetOptions` weight 0 and sets the low, medium, and high thresholds to 0/1/1.
- Steps with more than 100 operations split into batches of 100, the protocol limit per transaction.
- A step that turns out to be a no-op (no offers, no data entries) is skipped, not submitted.
- Soroban steps are one `InvokeHostFunction` per transaction, because each needs its own RPC simulation for footprint, authorization, and resource fee.
- The plan is recomputed on resume, so external changes between sessions are reconciled rather than blindly repeated.

Because a full wind-down is many sequential transactions, a single end-to-end dry run is not feasible. The tool's preview approach is two-tiered: a complete plan view up front (every step, its operations, its estimated fee, and the estimated final XLM that reaches the destination), and a per-step simulation immediately before each signature using `simulateTransaction` for Soroban steps and a build-and-validate check for classic steps. Any simulation failure is surfaced in plain language before the user is asked to sign, never after.

## 9. Closing positions: classic and Soroban DeFi

This is the part the existing reference tool cannot do, and the core of the technical work. Detection and unwinding are separated. The DeFi Position API (OctoPos or Orion) tells the tool *what* positions exist. The tool then constructs the *exit* transactions itself, per protocol, reading exact on-chain state over RPC and simulating before signing. The tool integrates each protocol through its published SDK, public API, or contract interface; it does not guess at contract shapes.

A versioned contract registry maps each pool or vault contract's `wasmHash` to a known protocol version. An unknown `wasmHash` flags that position for manual review rather than risking an exit transaction built against the wrong interface.

The protocols and their exit mechanics at a glance:

| Protocol | Position type | Detection | Exit mechanism | Integration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classic DEX | Order-book offers | Indexer | `ManageSellOffer` / `ManageBuyOffer` with amount 0 | Native operations |
| Classic AMM | Pool-share trustline | Indexer | `LiquidityPoolWithdraw`, then `ChangeTrust` limit 0 | Native operations |
| Blend | Supply (bToken), borrow (dToken), backstop | Position API | `Pool.submit` with Repay, Withdraw, WithdrawCollateral; backstop Q4W | `@blend-capital/blend-sdk` |
| Aquarius | AMM LP, AQUA rewards | Position API, contracts | `withdraw`, `claim` | Aquarius contracts and backend |
| Soroswap | AMM LP | Position API, factory | Router `remove_liquidity` | Soroswap API (builds XDR) |
| Phoenix | AMM LP, optional stake | Position API, contracts | `withdraw_liquidity`, `unstake` first if staked | Phoenix contracts |
| FxDAO | CDP vault (XLM collateral, stablecoin debt) | Position API, storage | `pay_debt`, then withdraw collateral | FxDAO vault contracts |

Coverage is driven by what users actually hold, not by market share. By current activity, Blend is the largest lending market and Aquarius the largest AMM, FxDAO is an active CDP protocol, and Soroswap and Phoenix are smaller. The tool supports all of them because a user with a position in any of them needs to close it to merge. A position in a frozen, deprecated, or winding-down contract must stay exitable: closing a position is exactly the withdraw-and-repay path such a contract still allows, so the tool reads contract status, surfaces it to the user, and never hides a position because its protocol changed state. The user's funds are still there.

### 9.1 Classic DEX offers

Open offers are cancelled with `ManageSellOffer` or `ManageBuyOffer` carrying the existing offer ID and `amount = 0`, which deletes the offer and frees its 0.5 XLM reserve. Passive sell offers, created with `CreatePassiveSellOffer`, are cancelled the same way. Offers batch at up to 100 per transaction. No external integration is needed; offers are enumerated from the indexer.

### 9.2 Classic Stellar liquidity pools

Stellar's native AMM (CAP-38, protocol 18 and later) holds a user's stake as a pool-share trustline, which costs two base reserves. The only operation that reduces shares is `LiquidityPoolWithdraw`, which burns shares and returns both reserve assets. The unwind is two steps: `LiquidityPoolWithdraw` for the full share balance, then `ChangeTrust` with limit 0 to remove the pool-share trustline. A pool-share trustline cannot be removed while shares remain, so ordering is enforced.

### 9.3 Blend (lending and borrowing)

Blend positions are read with the official [`@blend-capital/blend-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blend-capital/blend-sdk). Supply positions are held as bTokens, debt as dTokens. The tool exits a pool through the `Pool.submit` entry point, which takes a list of typed requests, each a `{ request_type, address, amount }`. The relevant request types are `Repay` (5), `Withdraw` (1), and `WithdrawCollateral` (3). Passing an amount larger than the position is clamped down to the actual balance, which the tool uses to fully exit without dust.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    detect["Detect Blend position<br/>(OctoPos / Orion)"] --> ver["Resolve pool version<br/>(wasmHash: V1 or V2)"]
    ver --> hasdebt{"Open dToken debt?"}
    hasdebt -->|"yes"| acquire["Acquire repayment asset if needed<br/>(route + PathPayment / swap)"]
    acquire --> repay["Repay (RequestType 5)"]
    hasdebt -->|"no"| withdraw
    repay --> hf{"Health factor stays >= 1.0?"}
    hf -->|"yes"| withdraw["Withdraw / WithdrawCollateral<br/>(RequestType 1 / 3)"]
    hf -->|"no"| block["Block step, explain risk"]
    withdraw --> backstop{"Backstop deposit?"}
    backstop -->|"queued (Q4W)"| wait["Show 17-day queue;<br/>proceed with rest, warn funds locked"]
    backstop -->|"none"| done["Position closed"]
```

The order is enforced: repay all dToken debt first, then withdraw bToken supply, because the protocol rejects collateral withdrawal that would leave a position undercollateralized. When the account lacks the asset to repay, the tool routes and acquires it first (Section 10). Blend's backstop module uses a queue-for-withdrawal (Q4W) cooldown of 17 days; the backstop token is the BLND:USDC 80/20 Comet LP share. If a backstop withdrawal is queued, the tool shows the remaining time, proceeds with the rest of the wind-down, and warns that the backstop funds stay locked until the queue clears. Blend has V1 and V2 pools on mainnet, and the SDK ships both contract clients, so the tool resolves the pool version per position before building the exit.

### 9.4 Aquarius (AMM)

Aquarius is a Soroban AMM. LP positions are withdrawn by calling the pool's `withdraw(user, share_amount, min_amounts)`, which burns shares and returns the reserve assets, with a minimum-received tolerance to bound slippage. Unclaimed AQUA rewards are read with `get_user_reward(user)` and claimed with `claim(user)` before withdrawal when the user opts in; claiming AQUA may require an AQUA trustline, which the tool adds and then resolves in the conversion step. Pools and positions are discovered from the DeFi Position API and the Aquarius backend, with direct contract reads over RPC as the fallback.

### 9.5 Soroswap

Soroswap is a Soroban AMM with a public [Soroswap API](https://docs.soroswap.finance/soroswap-api) that returns routes and builds XDR. LP withdrawal calls the router's `remove_liquidity(token_a, token_b, liquidity, amount_a_min, amount_b_min, to, deadline)`. Pairs are enumerated through the factory (`all_pairs_length`, `all_pairs`, `get_pair`), though in practice the DeFi Position API already reports which pairs the account holds. Where the tool relies on the Soroswap API to assemble a transaction, it signs and submits the API-built XDR directly rather than re-simulating it, which sidesteps a known Soroban `simulateTransaction` edge case around restored archival entries.

### 9.6 Phoenix

Phoenix is a Soroban AMM. The pool contract exposes `withdraw_liquidity(recipient, share_amount, min_a, min_b, deadline, auto_unstake)`, with a paired `provide_liquidity` for the deposit side, and `stake` / `unstake` on the staking contract. The tool uses the source contract names (`provide_liquidity` and `withdraw_liquidity`), withdraws the full share balance with a minimum-received bound, and unstakes first where a position is staked.

### 9.7 FxDAO

FxDAO is a CDP protocol: a user locks XLM collateral in a vault and mints a stablecoin (USDx for the USD denomination, with a 115% minimum collateral ratio). Closing a vault means repaying the stablecoin debt and withdrawing the XLM collateral. The vault contract tracks vaults in a sorted linked list, so debt repayment through `pay_debt` requires passing the neighboring vault keys, and vaults are enumerated through `get_vaults`. When the account does not hold enough stablecoin to repay, the tool acquires it through routing first. If a vault is undercollateralized at close time, automatic closure is not safe (it would invite liquidation), so the tool surfaces a clear error and asks the user to manage that vault manually.

### 9.8 What a protocol exit looks like end to end

For every Soroban exit the shape is the same: detect the position from the DeFi Position API, resolve the contract version from the registry by `wasmHash`, read exact on-chain amounts over RPC `getLedgerEntries` with `ScVal` decoding, build the `InvokeHostFunction` operation, simulate it over RPC to fill in footprint, authorization, and resource fee, present the simulation result to the user, sign client-side, submit, and poll for confirmation. The same adapter pattern that isolates OctoPos from Orion isolates each protocol's contract interface, so a protocol upgrade is a registry and adapter change, not a rewrite.

### 9.9 Exit adapter invariants

Because the operations are irreversible, every protocol exit adapter must satisfy the same invariants before its output is signed. These are the contract the adapters are held to, and what the test suite checks.

| Invariant | What it guarantees |
|---|---|
| Live re-read before build | Exit amounts come from a fresh `getLedgerEntries` read taken immediately before construction, never from cached or enumerated data |
| Simulate before sign | Every Soroban exit is simulated over RPC for footprint, authorization, and resource fee, and the result is shown before the user signs |
| Halt on unknown `wasmHash` | An unrecognized contract version flags the position for manual review and builds nothing, rather than encoding against the wrong interface |
| Clamp to balance | Exit amounts are clamped to the actual position, so a full exit leaves no dust and never over-withdraws |
| Minimum-received bound | Every swap or LP withdrawal carries a minimum-received amount derived from a fresh quote and a slippage tolerance |
| Repay before withdraw | Debt is repaid before collateral is withdrawn, and the resulting health factor is checked to stay at or above 1.0 |
| No silent skips | A position the tool cannot safely close (undercollateralized vault, unknown version, missing route) is surfaced as a blocker with an explanation, never quietly ignored |
| Deterministic plan | The same account state produces the same ordered plan, which keeps the flow auditable and testable |

## 10. Asset conversion and routing

After positions are unwound, the account may hold several classic and Soroban tokens. The tool converts each to XLM (or a user-chosen base asset) using the best available route, then removes the now-empty trustlines.

Routing has two engines. The primary is the Soroswap Aggregator API, which finds optimal routes across Soroswap, Phoenix, Aquarius, and the classic SDEX, handles both classic and Soroban tokens, and builds the swap XDR. The fallback for pure-classic assets is strict-send path finding from the indexer, executed with `PathPaymentStrictSend` across SDEX order books and classic liquidity pools (up to six hops). Either way the tool computes a minimum-received amount from the quoted output and a slippage tolerance, and passes it as the destination minimum so a sudden price move cannot fill the swap at a bad rate.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    asset["Non-XLM balance"] --> q["Quote route<br/>(Soroswap aggregator; SDEX paths fallback)"]
    q --> hasroute{"Route found?"}
    hasroute -->|"yes"| minrecv["Compute minimum received<br/>(quote x (1 - slippage))"]
    minrecv --> kind{"Token kind"}
    kind -->|"classic"| pp["PathPaymentStrictSend<br/>(dest_min = minimum received)"]
    kind -->|"Soroban"| inv["InvokeHostFunction swap<br/>(min_out = minimum received)"]
    pp --> conv["Converted to XLM"]
    inv --> conv
    hasroute -->|"no"| opt["Offer user a choice:<br/>return asset to issuer, or<br/>forward balance to a third-party address"]
    conv --> rm["Remove trustline (ChangeTrust limit 0)"]
```

The user keeps control. They can skip conversion for any asset and instead forward the balance to another wallet or exchange, and where no route exists the tool offers to return the asset to its issuer rather than stranding it. A trustline is only removed once its balance is zero; if a residual balance remains after conversion, the tool either returns it to the issuer or lets the user lower slippage and retry rather than silently failing the later merge.

## 11. The mediator account flow for exchanges

Exchanges do not support `ACCOUNT_MERGE`, so a user cannot merge directly into a deposit address. The tool uses a temporary mediator account, the same pattern the reference demolisher uses, made transparent to the user.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Source account
    participant M as Mediator (temporary)
    participant D as Destination (exchange deposit)

    Note over S,M: Mediator created and funded from the source account
    S->>M: AccountMerge (transfers all XLM into mediator)
    Note over M: Mediator now holds the recovered funds
    M->>D: Payment (forwards funds, with required memo)
    Note over D: Exchange credits the user by address + memo
    Note over M: Mediator retains 1 XLM base reserve (disclosed cost)
```

The mediator is a standard Stellar account. The tool generates an ephemeral keypair in the browser, funds the account from the source account during a prepare step, uses the key once to sign the forward payment, then clears the key from memory. The user can also supply their own mediator key. The flow's one cost, the 1 XLM that stays as the mediator's own base reserve, is disclosed up front rather than hidden. When the destination is a known exchange or anchor, the tool requires the correct memo and blocks submission without it, because funds sent to an exchange without a memo are typically lost.

A registry of known exchange and anchor addresses, sourced from the stellar.expert directory, drives two decisions: whether a destination needs the mediator flow, and whether it requires a memo and of which type (text, id, or hash).

## 12. Allowance inspection

Independent of closing an account, the tool offers a read-only allowance inspector. This is a security utility: a user who has approved token spending to DeFi contracts can audit and revoke those approvals, which limits exposure if a protocol is later exploited.

Soroban tokens follow the [SEP-41](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0041.md) interface, including `approve(from, spender, amount, expiration_ledger)` and `allowance(from, spender)`. There is no on-chain way to list every spender an account has approved, so the inspector discovers candidate spenders from `approve` events (RPC `getEvents`, with the indexer for older windows) and from the known DeFi contract registry, then reads `allowance(owner, spender)` for each. Non-zero allowances are shown with the token, the spender contract and its protocol name when recognized, the approved amount, and the expiration ledger. Revoking sets the allowance to zero with `approve(owner, spender, 0, ledger)`, one `InvokeHostFunction` per revocation, and requires no full wind-down.

## 13. Security model

The tool builds transactions that drain an account irreversibly, so its security model starts from the assumption that only the user's own machine should ever be able to sign.

### 13.1 What is at risk and who attacks it

| Asset | Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Private key | Total account control | Never transmitted; wallet path keeps it in the wallet; secret-key path keeps it in memory only |
| Signed transaction | One-time execution of a step | Built and submitted client-side; user reviews XDR and confirms before submission |
| Destination address | Funds sent to the wrong place | Full-address display, ledger existence check, explicit verification before merge |
| Memo | Lost funds at an exchange | Required and validated for known exchange and anchor destinations |

A compromised backend cannot sign or move funds, because it never holds keys and is never in the signing path. It could return wrong read data; the client defends against that with on-chain simulation and explicit user confirmation of every destructive step. A passive network observer sees only TLS-protected read traffic. An XSS attacker is constrained by a strict Content Security Policy with no inline scripts and no `unsafe-eval`. A supply-chain attacker is constrained by lockfile-pinned dependencies, audited in CI, with no dependency permitted that needs dynamic code execution.

### 13.2 Key handling

The wallet path is primary: through stellar-wallets-kit the private key never enters the application. The secret-key advanced mode is for keys not held in any wallet, and is constrained: the input is a password field, the key is held only in memory (never in `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, IndexedDB, cookies, or any network request), it is cleared immediately after each signing operation, and the component holding it is unmounted when the user leaves the signing step. For multisig, keys are gathered one at a time, each cleared right after its signature is applied. The ephemeral mediator key is generated in the browser, used once, and nulled; only its public key is recorded for recovery and transparency.

### 13.3 Confirmation and irreversibility controls

Every destructive step requires an explicit acknowledgment that states what will happen, shows the affected entry or balance, and warns that it cannot be undone. The tool never auto-submits; the user triggers each submission. The merge gets its own full-screen confirmation with the destination shown in full, a ledger existence check, and memo validation for exchange destinations.

### 13.4 Audit

Given the irreversibility, the project commits to a third-party security audit before any mainnet release, coordinated through Stellar's Audit Bank where possible. The audit scope is the key-handling surface, the CSP and XSS surface, the transaction construction logic (operation encoding, fee estimation, envelope handling), and the mediator flow. Critical and high findings are remediated before public mainnet launch; findings and their remediation status are published in the repository.

## 14. Trust minimization, decentralization, and self-hosting

For a tool that closes accounts, decentralization is first a matter of custody and control, and second a matter of who can run it.

Custody and control. The tool is non-custodial by construction. Signing is client-side, keys never reach a server, and the backend is read-only. No operator of any component, including the maintainers, can move a user's funds or close their account. The user authorizes every transaction.

Who can run it. The whole project is open source under a permissive license, and the code that builds and signs transactions runs in the user's browser where anyone can read it. The tool deploys as a single Next.js service, so anyone can run their own instance with Docker or any Node host. Every external read source is behind a pluggable adapter, so a self-hoster can point the tool at their own Stellar RPC node, their preferred indexer, and their preferred DeFi Position API instance. The canonical deployment is a convenience, not a requirement: nothing about the tool depends on a server only the maintainers can run.

Where centralization remains, and why. The remaining centralized pieces are all read-only data sources: RPC providers, the indexer, the routing API, and the DeFi Position API. None can affect custody. Each is pluggable and has multiple independent providers in the Stellar ecosystem, so no single one is a hard dependency. The DeFi Position API is a deliberate dependency, satisfied with two independent providers (OctoPos and Orion) behind automatic fallback, precisely so that no single provider is a point of failure.

| Component | Ownership | Reach | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application (UI and read-only API) | Open source, self-hostable | Open | One Next.js service, deployable with Docker or any Node host; holds no keys and no custody |
| Transaction builder and signing | Open source, runs client-side | Open | The security-critical code; signing never leaves the browser |
| Contract and exchange registries | Open source, community pull requests | Open | Versioned JSON, updated by reviewed pull request |
| Stellar RPC access | Pluggable provider | External, read-only | Ecosystem providers or a self-hosted node |
| Subentry enumeration | Pluggable indexer | External, read-only | stellar.expert API or a Horizon-compatible provider |
| Swap routing | Pluggable | External, read-only | Soroswap Aggregator API or SDEX paths |
| DeFi position detection | Pluggable, dual-provider | External, read-only | OctoPos primary, Orion fallback |

Nothing in the open rows can move funds. Everything in the external rows is read-only and replaceable.

## 15. Infrastructure and deployment

The tool runs on light, replaceable infrastructure, which follows from the non-custodial design.

- Application: a single Next.js service that serves the guided UI and the read-only API routes. It holds no per-user state and no keys, so it scales horizontally behind a load balancer. A published Docker image lets anyone self-host it.
- Cache: a Redis instance holds short-lived public read data only.
- Stellar access: Stellar RPC through ecosystem providers, configurable per deployment, with the option to run a self-hosted RPC node.
- Data services: the stellar.expert API for enumeration and the Soroswap API for routing, both pluggable; the DeFi Position API (OctoPos primary, Orion fallback).

The project commits to using the current stable Stellar stack: the latest `@stellar/stellar-sdk`, Stellar RPC, stellar-wallets-kit, and the live network protocol (Protocol 25, with Protocol 26 rolling out as of mid-2026). The contract registry and protocol adapters are versioned so the tool tracks protocol and DeFi upgrades without a rebuild of its core logic.

## 16. User protection and privacy

The tool protects users on two fronts: their funds and their privacy.

Funds. The irreversibility controls in Section 13 are the protection: explicit per-step confirmations, no auto-submission, destination verification, memo validation for exchanges, per-step simulation before signing, and a resume flow that reconciles against on-chain state so an interrupted wind-down never double-acts.

Privacy. The tool collects no personal information and requires no account. Secret keys never leave the browser and are never logged. The backend handles only public addresses, which it does not retain beyond cache TTLs, and it associates no identity with a request. Any product analytics are privacy-preserving and self-hosted (for example Plausible or Umami) with no personal data, no cross-site tracking, and IP anonymization; the default is to ship no third-party trackers at all, and the Content Security Policy blocks third-party scripts. Abuse protection on the read-only backend is rate limiting by IP, which needs no stored identity.

## 17. Testing strategy

Testing matters more than usual here because the operations are irreversible and touch real balances. The suite has four tiers, all run in CI, and automated tests never touch mainnet.

- Unit: pure logic with deterministic fixtures. Transaction construction, fee estimation, reserve and balance math, routing parameter derivation, state machine transitions, input validation, and batching. The transaction builder is the highest-coverage module.
- Integration: against Stellar testnet with accounts funded by Friendbot at the start of each run. Account analysis, signer removal, offer cancellation, trustline removal, asset conversion, the merge, and each DeFi protocol exit.
- Adversarial and edge case: deliberately unusual or hostile account states. Sponsoring accounts, the 1000-subentry maximum, revoked trustlines, multisig with hash(x) and pre-auth signers, undercollateralized vaults, queued backstop withdrawals, high-slippage conversions, and network failures such as a confirmed transaction whose response is lost (detected on retry through `getTransaction` so the step is not resubmitted).
- End to end: Playwright drives a real browser against testnet through the full flow, including the multisig path, the mediator path for exchange destinations, session recovery, and the allowance inspector.

## 18. Maintenance after launch

The design isolates the parts most likely to change.

Protocols upgrade, and DeFi contracts get redeployed. The versioned contract registry maps `wasmHash` to protocol version, so a new protocol version is a registry update (a reviewed pull request), not a code change. An unknown `wasmHash` degrades gracefully: the affected position is flagged for manual review instead of risking a wrong exit. Each protocol and each data provider sits behind an adapter, so adding a protocol or swapping a provider is a contained change. Dependencies are pinned and audited in CI, with weekly update pull requests. The repository carries a security policy and a responsible-disclosure process. Maintenance commitments, the cadence of protocol-coverage review, and the community update rhythm are detailed in the [community and communications](/community-and-communications) document.

## 19. Delivery plan

The work is delivered in three cumulative tranches, each a working, independently verifiable artifact.

| Tranche | Focus | Key acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Classic MVP | Full classic wind-down on testnet: signer normalization, data entries, offer cancellation, classic liquidity pool withdrawal, asset conversion via SDEX paths, trustline removal, merge, and the mediator flow. Wallet and secret-key signing, multisig, session recovery. | All classic steps execute correctly on testnet; multisig account closed with multiple keys; mediator flow works for exchange destinations; sessions resume from on-chain state; all errors render in plain language; transaction builder above 80% coverage. |
| 2. Soroban and DeFi | Full Soroban parity: DeFi position detection via OctoPos with Orion fallback; Blend, Aquarius, Soroswap, Phoenix, and FxDAO exits; Soroban token conversion; the allowance inspector; per-step simulation. | Each protocol's positions detected, unwound, and confirmed on testnet; provider fallback within seconds; degraded mode when both providers are down; Soroban fee estimates within tolerance of submitted fees. |
| 3. Production hardening | Third-party security audit and remediation; mainnet deployment; performance and load validation; final UX from user testing; complete public documentation. | Audit complete with critical and high findings remediated and published; mainnet deployment live; CSP verified with no `unsafe-eval`; analysis within performance targets; repository public under a permissive license. |

The [RFP compliance matrix](/rfp-compliance) ties each tranche to the specific RFP requirements it satisfies.

## 20. Traction

The classic wind-down already runs. The current codebase is a working Next.js application that, on both networks, reads account state over Stellar RPC and the stellar.expert API, builds and signs classic transactions client-side, and executes the full path: signer normalization, data entry removal, offer cancellation, asset conversion through SDEX path payments, trustline removal, and `AccountMerge`, including the mediator flow for exchange destinations with the correct memo handling. It carries an exchange registry, IndexedDB session recovery, unit tests over the plan builder and helpers, and Playwright end-to-end coverage. This is the foundation the Soroban and DeFi work builds on, and the evidence that the team is already executing rather than starting from a blank page.

## 21. Technology stack and standards

Plain-English summary of what the tool is built from and why.

- Frontend: Next.js and TypeScript, an open source and self-hostable web app, with TypeScript's type safety valuable when constructing transactions.
- Stellar SDK: `@stellar/stellar-sdk`, the official SDK, which covers classic and Soroban.
- Wallets: stellar-wallets-kit, for one interface across Freighter, xBull, Albedo, LOBSTR, Rabet, Hana, WalletConnect, and more, including Soroban authorization-entry signing.
- Network access: Stellar RPC for live reads, simulation, submission, and events; the stellar.expert API for subentry enumeration; the Soroswap Aggregator API for routing; OctoPos and Orion for DeFi position detection.
- DeFi integration: the official Blend SDK, the Soroswap API, and the published contract interfaces for Aquarius, Phoenix, and FxDAO, behind per-protocol adapters and a versioned contract registry.
- State and storage: Zustand for the wizard state machine, IndexedDB for resumable sessions (never keys).
- Backend: read-only API routes within the same Next.js service, stateless, with a Redis cache for short-lived public read data.
- Testing: the Bun test runner for units, Playwright for end-to-end on testnet.

### Standards we build on

The tool tracks the current stable protocol (Protocol 25, with Protocol 26 rolling out as of mid-2026) and the latest `@stellar/stellar-sdk`. It builds on these ecosystem standards:

| Standard | What it is | How the tool uses it |
|---|---|---|
| SEP-41 | Soroban token interface | Reads `balance` and `allowance`, revokes with `approve(owner, spender, 0, ledger)` for the allowance inspector, and handles Soroban token balances during conversion |
| SEP-43 | Wallet interface implemented by stellar-wallets-kit | `signTransaction` and `signAuthEntry` across ecosystem wallets, with no per-wallet code |
| CAP-38 | Classic liquidity pools (protocol 18) | `LiquidityPoolWithdraw` and pool-share trustline removal |
| SEP-40 | Oracle consumer interface | Reading a Blend pool's oracle price when validating that a partial repay keeps the health factor at or above 1.0 |
| Stellar Asset Contract (CAP-46-6) | Classic assets usable inside Soroban | Bridging classic balances and contract balances when converting Soroban-side |

## 22. Failure modes and recovery

The tool never leaves the user guessing. Every failure is either retryable with a clear path or surfaced as a blocker with a manual resolution, and partial progress is always recoverable from on-chain state.

| Failure | What the tool does |
|---|---|
| RPC unavailable | Reads pause and retry with exponential backoff; the user sees a clear status and a retry, and no state changes |
| Indexer or position API unavailable | The classic flow proceeds; DeFi detection enters degraded mode with a warning to verify positions manually |
| Partial position data | Affected positions are flagged; the tool builds no exit from incomplete data |
| Step fails on submission | The step is marked failed with a plain-language reason; the user retries the same step; later steps stay locked |
| Confirmation response lost | On retry the tool checks `getTransaction`; if the transaction already confirmed, the step is marked complete rather than resubmitted |
| Sequence or fee issue | The tool rebuilds with the current sequence number and a higher fee within the disclosed tolerance, then re-presents for signing |
| Browser closed mid-flow | The session restores from IndexedDB and reconciles against on-chain state; completed steps are skipped |
| Soroban entry archived | A long-dormant account may have archived contract entries; the tool detects this and inserts a `RestoreFootprint` step before the exit |
| Undercollateralized vault or unknown contract version | Surfaced as a blocker with an explanation; independent steps in the plan can still proceed |

## 23. Open questions and known risks

These are the items the team is actively resolving. Listing them is deliberate: a tool that drains accounts should be honest about what is still being pinned down.

| Area | Open question or risk |
|---|---|
| FxDAO exit | Confirm the exact collateral-withdrawal entrypoint and the linked-list neighbor-key handling for `pay_debt` against the current contracts, and the full set of supported stablecoin denominations |
| Soroswap simulation | Confirm the precise `simulateTransaction` edge case and the raw JSON-RPC submission pattern against the current Soroswap API and protocol version |
| DeFi Position API specs | Pin the exact OctoPos and Orion fields the adapter maps (health factor, staleness, attribution confidence) and coordinate with both teams |
| Multisig signer types | hash(x) and pre-auth transaction signers cannot be signed automatically; define the manual pre-image and pre-auth paths |
| Dry-run depth | A full end-to-end simulation across many sequential transactions is not feasible; user testing must confirm that per-step simulation plus the plan view is enough |
| Soroban state archival | Archived ledger entries on dormant accounts may need a `RestoreFootprint` operation before an exit; confirm the handling end to end |
| Coverage drift | Protocols change market share and contract versions; the registry and adapters track this, and coverage priorities are reviewed against on-chain activity |

## 24. Glossary

- Base reserve: the unit of locked XLM, currently 0.5 XLM. An account's minimum balance is two base reserves plus one per subentry.
- Subentry: a trustline, offer, data entry, or signer attached to an account. Each adds one base reserve to the minimum balance; a pool-share trustline adds two.
- `ACCOUNT_MERGE`: the operation that transfers an account's full XLM balance to a destination and deletes the source account. Requires no subentries and no sponsorships.
- Sponsorship: an arrangement where one account pays the reserve for another account's entry. A sponsoring account cannot be merged until it stops sponsoring.
- Trustline: an account's declared ability to hold a given asset, with a balance and a limit. Removed with `ChangeTrust` set to limit 0 once the balance is zero.
- Stellar RPC: the JSON-RPC interface for live ledger reads (`getLedgerEntries`), Soroban simulation (`simulateTransaction`), submission (`sendTransaction`), confirmation (`getTransaction`), and events (`getEvents`). It cannot enumerate an account's unknown subentries.
- Indexer: a service that indexes ledger history and exposes enumeration, such as the stellar.expert API or a Horizon-compatible provider. The tool reads enumeration from an existing indexer rather than running its own.
- `InvokeHostFunction`: the Stellar operation that calls a Soroban smart contract. Each one is simulated over RPC to determine its footprint, authorization, and resource fee.
- `ScVal`: the value encoding used by Soroban contracts. The tool decodes `ScVal` results when reading on-chain position state.
- `wasmHash`: the hash identifying a deployed contract's code. The tool maps it to a known protocol version to pick the correct exit interface.
- bToken / dToken: Blend's representations of a supply position (bToken) and a debt position (dToken).
- Q4W: Blend's queue-for-withdrawal cooldown on backstop deposits, currently 17 days.
- CDP: a collateralized debt position, the FxDAO model where XLM collateral backs minted stablecoin.
- SAC: the Stellar Asset Contract, which lets a classic asset (and XLM) be used inside Soroban contracts. It implements the SEP-41 token interface.
- Mediator account: a temporary account used to forward funds to a destination that does not support `ACCOUNT_MERGE`, such as an exchange.
